# Special purpose entity

The Livepeer treasury is allocated to ecosystem projects via so-called [special-purpose entities](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-90.md) (SPEs) who vie for budget allocations through a competitive grant application process. A dashboard of SPE with active funding allocations can be found [here](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/livepeer).

## Scenarios

An SPE or prospective SPE operator must develop Livepeer ecosystem programmes and apply to the DAO for funding.

* Identify opportunities for funded contributions.
  * Into which focus areas are funds most likely to be allocated?
    * *Data availability score: 0* (no treasury allocation strategy)
    * *Potential resource.* Develop and publich ecosystem funding strategy.
  * How much existing competition for funding is there in my focus area?
    * *Resource.* Trawling [Treasury forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/c/treasury/18)
    * *Data availability score: 4*
* Decide parameters (amount, focus area) to pitch an application for funding.
  * How much have previous grant applicants in similar focus areas received?
    * *Resource.* Trawling [Treasury forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/c/treasury/18)
    * *Data availability score: 4*
  * Which grants were rejected or revisions requested because they asked for too much funding or support?
    * *Resource.* Trawling [Treasury forum](https://forum.livepeer.org/c/treasury/18)
    * *Data availability score: 4*

**Views:** Governance (all subviews).

## Gaps

* Unified view of strategic direction of Livepeer DAO, protocol research or product development themes, and special focus areas for funding.
* Summary of market compensation rates for Treasury-funded projects.
* Summary of treasury balance, budget, projections, and aggregated funding history tagged by grant category.
