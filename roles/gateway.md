# Gateway

[Gateways](https://docs.livepeer.org/gateways/guides/gateway-overview) are entities that aggregate customer requests for video transcoding and, more recently, AI workloads, and distribute the jobs to Livepeer's network of Orchestrators (GPU nodes). [Some earlier sources](https://livepeer-ac43ab.webflow.io/primer) refer to this role as **broadcaster**. The [highest revenue gateways](https://dune.com/rickstaa/livepeer-ai) are the ones operated by Livepeer Inc. (via [Livepeer Studio](https://livepeer.studio) and the Agent SPE.

## Gaps

* Clear explanation of the Gateway role within Livepeer.
* Clear, discoverable explanation of current status quo on Protocol-level measures to mitigate fault risks, particularly safety faults.
* Production-grade, transparent Orchestrator directory with performance and reliability data and extended capability reporting. 
  * Livepeer Tools Orchestrator page is a good start, but seems to be down often, "latency score" is unclear, data source is unclear, and is not discoverable through the explorer.
* Targeted grant or subsidy programme for new Gateways in focus areas.
