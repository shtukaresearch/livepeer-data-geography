# Livepeer roles

We classify Livepeer ecosystem activities into seven **roles** split across five entity types.

* Foundation
* Gateway
* Investor-delegator
* Orchestrator-delegate
* SPE (funding applicant)

The interactions between these entity types can be summarised as follows:

* **Gateways** aggregate requests for GPU compute from users and distribute them as jobs to **Orchestrators.**
* LPT **Investors** delegate (stake) LPT to **Delegates** in exchange for yield.
* **Delegates** vote on proposals to allocate funding from the Livepeer Treasury to **SPE**s.
* The **Foundation** proposes strategic objectives and programmes to guide the decision-making of **Delegates**.
