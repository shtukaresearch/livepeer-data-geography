# Investor-delegator

In our model, an Investor is an entity that makes decisions about investing capital into LPT, especially for the longer term (one year or more). We expect that such investors are interested mainly in "fundamentals" of the LPT token, that is, the potential for Livepeer Network revenue growth and expectations about the extent to which the value of that revenue accrues to the token, dilution due to issuance, and risks such as governance risk, liquidity overhang, peer competitors and general dePIN or web3 market headwinds.

An investor that holds LPT has the further option of [*delegating*](https://www.livepeer.org/delegate) (or *staking*) their LPT to one or more [Delegates](https://explorer.livepeer.org/orchestrators) (Orchestrators) in exchange for a share of LPT issuance and the ETH-denominated compute fees earned by those Orchestrators.

## Gaps

### Invest

* Clear statement of the role of network revenue and fee cuts in driving value to LPT. Summary of network revenue share that accrues to LPT.
* Easily discoverable statement of the function of LPT voting and its legal or smart contractual relationship to the Livepeer Network.
* Accurate, credible representation of onchain liquidity including PMM liquidity. 
* Foundation/DAO strategy to ensure future liquidity.
* Relevant market information (sector performance, investment reports, news, price feeds) accessible through Livepeer-owned portal.

### Delegate

* Issuance forecast represented as dilution (of liquid LPT) or marginal supply share growth (of staked LPT). Market impact of LPT deposit.
* Clear statement of withdrawal conditions, offramp path, and risk.
* Integration of staking information into staking market trackers.
  * [DePINscan](https://depinscan.io/staking) has a listing of dePIN tokens that offer "staking," and the token page can show a staking panel that displays reward rate, TVL, and embeds a widget to deposit stake. ([Example](https://depinscan.io/projects/filecoin)) Livepeer is missing from this list, and the stake widget is missing from [Livepeer's token page](https://depinscan.io/projects/livepeer).
  * [Staking Rewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/livepeer) has no data for LPT staking.
* Delegation strategy simulator / recommendation engine based on projected yield, risk (missed claims) and voting activity.
