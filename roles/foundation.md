# Livepeer Foundation

The [Livepeer Foundation](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/launching-the-livepeer-foundation/2849) was launched in April 2025 with the mission:

> [...] to steward the long-term vision, ecosystem growth, and core development of the network.

Broadly speaking, the Livepeer Foundation makes decisions in the following areas:

1. Define strategic objectives for Livepeer
2. Design initiatives to accelerate or steer progress towards objectives
3. Drawing on available resources, recruit and coordinate task forces to execute on initiatives
4. Foundation operations

From the perspective of identifying Livepeer Network and ecosystem data gaps, we regard internal Foundation operations as out of scope.

## Scenarios

* What resources are available to the Livepeer ecosystem (comprising Foundation and DAO) to execute on given objectives?

  * Financial (Foundation treasury, Livepeer treasury, income streams).
  * Talent (contributor tracking)
    * Market compensation rates

* What are the most promising areas of growth?

  * G growth. Revenue trends + tagging

    * *Resource.* Data recorded by gateways. *Data availability score: 2*
    * *Resource.* `WinningTicketRedeemed` event logs. *Data availability score: 4*
    * *Potential resource.* Network-wide job type aggregator

  * I growth. LPT as a product.

    * *Resource.* Investor report platforms such as Messari.
    * *Resource.* Metrics from raw market data.

  * O growth. Orchestrator tiers, identifying data.

* What parts of the Livepeer system are leaving participants dissatisfied (or perhaps dissuading prospective new participants)?

      * Frontend usage statistics via centralised onboarding widget?

  * Funding gaps. 

    Where could Foundation funding be allocated effectively that currently doesn't have a route to acquire funding?

    What about Treasury funding? Can the Foundation unlock routes to deploying that funding?

    * Capital management (9)

    * Grants programmes.

      *Resource.* Treasury trackers. Grant milestone trackers. Vote trackers.
