# Livepeer Foundation

The [Livepeer Foundation](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/launching-the-livepeer-foundation/2849) was launched in April 2025 with the mission:

> [...] to steward the long-term vision, ecosystem growth, and core development of the network.

Broadly speaking, the Livepeer Foundation makes decisions in the following areas:

1. Define strategic objectives for Livepeer
2. Design initiatives to accelerate or steer progress towards objectives
3. Drawing on available resources, recruit and coordinate task forces to execute on initiatives
4. Foundation operations

From the perspective of identifying Livepeer Network and ecosystem data gaps, we regard internal Foundation operations as out of scope.
