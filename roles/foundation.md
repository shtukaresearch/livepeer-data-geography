# Livepeer Foundation

The [Livepeer Foundation](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/launching-the-livepeer-foundation/2849) was launched in April 2025 with the mission:

> [...] to steward the long-term vision, ecosystem growth, and core development of the network.

Broadly speaking, the Livepeer Foundation makes decisions in the following areas:

1. Define strategic objectives for Livepeer
2. Design initiatives to accelerate or steer progress towards objectives
3. Drawing on available resources, recruit and coordinate task forces to execute on initiatives
4. Foundation operations

From the perspective of identifying Livepeer Network and ecosystem data gaps, we regard internal Foundation operations as out of scope.

Many of the Foundation's scenarios require them to see things from the perspective of a prospective user (gateway), node operator (orchestrator), or investor (delegator), so there is a large overlap in the set of characteristic queries.

## Scenarios

* Evaluate Livepeer's current position within the competitive landscape for GPU compute.

  * See [Gateway](./gateway.md).
* Develop policies to stimulate demand growth.
  * What are demand areas in the wider market where new gateways could be incentivised to jump in and serve demand using Livepeer?
    * *Potential source.* Offerings from competitors, expert consultation.
  * How much subsidy would be needed to clear barriers to entry for new Gateways?
* Evaluate Livepeer's current position within the competitive landscape for supplying infrastructure.

  * See [Orchestrator-Delegate](./orchestrator-delegate.md).
* Develop policies to stimulate node operator growth.
* Evaluate the current position of LPT within the investment landscape.

  * See [Investor-Delegator](./investor-delegator.md).
    
* Develop policies to stimulate investment and stake growth.
* Evaluate coordination gaps that could be filled by the Foundation.

  * Brand/marketing.
  * Talent and partner coordination.
  * R&D leadership.
* Identify funding gaps and opportunities to deploy idle capital.

  * What proportion of budget is currently allocated to furthering each objective area?
    * *Source.* Ad hoc summation of figures from Treasury forum and KarmaGAP
    * *Potential source.* Official summaries.
    * *Potential source.* Clear statement of budget allocation to broad objective categories.
  * How much idle capital is there in the Livepeer Treasury, and what are our plans for its deployment?
    * *Data availability score: 0* (no budget and no way to determine if capital is really "idle")
* Gather community and expert views on strategic objective setting.

  * *Source.* Community engagement, AB process.
* Design tactical initiatives to accelerate or steer progress towards objectives.

  * What resources are available within the ecosystem to direct towards strategic goals?

    * Contributor/SPE?
      * *Source.* [KarmaGAP SPE dashboard](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/livepeer)
    * Funding? Foundation treasury, Livepeer treasury, income streams.
      * *Data availability score: 4 (treasury), 2 (other)*
      * *Source.* [Treasury dash](https://dune.com/dob/livepeer-treasury)
      * *Potential source.* Treasury income forecast based on chain data and integrated into dashboard.
        * *Representation.* Fan chart

  * What metrics are there to track progress towards goals?

    * *Potential source.* Clear statement of metrics-based objectives, e.g. GPU time utilisation.

  * Where could Foundation or Treasury funding be allocated effectively that currently doesn't have a route to acquire funding?

    * Capital management (9)

    * Grants programmes.

      * *Resource.* Treasury trackers. Grant milestone trackers. Vote trackers.
* Recruit and coordinate task forces to execute on initiatives.

  * What ecosystem partners or contributors should we contact directly to execute on a task?
    * *Source.* [KarmaGAP SPE dashboard](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/livepeer)
  * How much budget should be allocated to a given initiative?
    * What are market or in-ecosystem compensation rates for standard categories of contribution?
      * *Source.* Livepeer forum, [KarmaGAP SPE reports](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/livepeer)
      * *Potential source.* Market-wide compensation rates reporting
  * If contributions are solicitied via RFPs, how do we set minimum standards for responses and what criteria do we use to pick winners?



## Gaps

* Strategy statements: strategic budget allocation, metrics based objectives.
* Budget, capital management strategy.
* Integrated view of Livepeer Treasury with spending areas marked, itemised budget, and income forecast.
