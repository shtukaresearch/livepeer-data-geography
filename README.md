# Livepeer data geography

This repository describes a model for the Livepeer ecosystem from a data perspective and documents discoverability gaps.

## Contents

* `/roles/` Description of six roles in the Livepeer ecosystem and their characteristic decision scenarios with a view to identifying data needs.
* `/views/` Classification of Livepeer ecosystem data queries into six views, lists of existing resources belonging to those views, and gaps.
* `/model.md` Model description.

## Summary of findings

We identified a few focus areas for improvements:

* **Orchestrator performance data.**
* **Demand tagging.**
* **Protocol research.**
* **Staking forecasts.** Already available through the explorer but could be improved.
* **Treasury dashboard.**
* **Livepeer Tools.** The [livepeer.tools](https://livepeer.tools) site appears to be down often and is not discoverable through official entry points such as the explorer. Much could be gained by simply improving the frontend's reliability and integrating its representations into an official explorer. Key gaps including the Orchestrator performance data and delegate voting track record are partly filled by this resource.
