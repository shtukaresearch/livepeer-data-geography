# Governance view

View of the governance context and decision-making of the Livepeer ecosystem. Comprises four sub-views:

* **Coordination.** Org chart, partners, SPEs, contributors.
* **Treasury.** Treasury deployment (budget, grants, capital management).
* **Protocol.** Protocol research, LIPs.
* **Delegates.** Delegate voting behaviour.
