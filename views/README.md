# Livepeer views

The queries associated with each of the seven [roles](../roles.md) in the Livepeer ecosystem can be grouped into six **views**.

They are:

* **Demand view.** Aggregate and categorised view of *demand* viewed through the lens of gateway demand for Orchestrator compute. Job request count, breakdown by job type and tagged source (by gateway, by app, etc.), and fee revenue fit into this view.
* **Supply view.** View of aggregate and per-orchestrator compute costs, performance, risk, and capacity.
* **Staking view.**  View of staking yield and risks across individual orchestrators and in aggregate. Dilution/concentration. Can also be thought of as supply view for staking.
* **Delegator view.** View of delegation activity among LPT holders. Bonding and unbonding events and token owner concentration. Can also be thought of as a demand view for staking.
* **Market view.** View of LPT as an investment in the context of its containing market. Fundamentals (revenue growth, strategy, capital access), trading data, peer competitors and headwinds (within dePIN, in web3, in tradcloud, etc.).
* **Governance view.** View of the governance context and decision-making of the Livepeer ecosystem. Comprises four sub-views:
  * **Coordination.** Org chart, partners, SPEs, contributors.
  * **Treasury.** Treasury deployment (budget, grants, capital management).
  * **Protocol.** Protocol research, LIPs.
  * **Delegates.** Delegate voting behaviour.















What about builder activity? It depends on what they are building, who paid for it, and why.

* Companies building on Livepeer video processing capability. Falls into **demand** view.
* Public goods builders. Falls into **governance/coordination** view.
* Building on LPT, e.g. liquid staking. Liquid staking apps are a source of demand for staked tokens, so falls into **staking** view.
